         IPv6 Multi-homing without Network Address Translation
                draft-troan-multihoming-without-nat66-00

Abstract

   Since IPv6 providing vast of global unique address space, which
   should be conserved with NAT in IPv4, all Internet community have
   been trying to deploy IPv6 then enjoy end-to-end transparency.
   Unfortunately, there is multihoming that unavoidable using IPv6 NAT
   with current IPv6 standard protocol suite.  In an IPv4 multihomed
   network, NAT works well for solving multihoming problems such as next
   hop resolution, source address selection and DNS resolution.  Since
   these functions are not yet defined for IPv6, there are some proposed
   solution to provide these functions.  In this document, we analyze
   these functions that was conjuncted with NAT, and also describe the
   requirements for multihoming that excludes NAT in IPv6.  We then
   introduce useful activity for these, then support it strongly.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 multi-homing withou NAT            April 2010


1.  Introduction

   Since IPv6 providing vast of global unique address space, which
   should be conserved with NAT in IPv4, all Internet community have
   been trying to deploy IPv6 then enjoy end-to-end transparency.

   Unfortunately, such dream would be corrupted by the necessity of NAT
   even in IPv6.  The reason is Multihoming.

   With the vast IPv6 address space, global unique address need to be no
   longer conserved to use.  Service providers or enterprise network
   administrators would thus be able to distribute their managed
   addresses, then, spread their network anywhere consequently.

   Multi-homing is now available on IPv6 networks.  Even a host that is
   connected to an service provider or an enterprise network for
   example, tunneling and VPN technology made possible to connect it to
   other network and configure their managed address.

   From network operators point of view, controlling quality of
   connectivity and security for a network based on its global unique
   address must be highly usefulness, and also convenient.  Hence there
   is no longer need to use private addresses at all, how good for
   operators!

   Multihoming has been spreading along with enlarging IPv6 deployment.
   While a host to which connecting several networks at the same time,
   the host has correspond addresses on which each service provider is
   controlling based.  This is an predictable consequent as the matter
   of course.

   However, how do the host know where the one to whom I send packets
   is?  While the host is multihomed, appropriate next-hop exists for
   each of connected network respectively.  Routing table is effective
   for next-hop resolution of course.  Even though more than one next-
   hop exist, the default route can only resolve single next-hop.  Who
   would activate routing protocol to advertise all amount of routes to
   the host which is tiny leaf of network?

   The question of host choosing an address from addresses, which multi-
   homed host has had on directly connected link, that would be a big
   problem.  When we assume that host select an address arbitrary or
   randomly, and then send packets to the network.  As a predictable
   result, the almost packets would be filtered out since the network
   operator partitioning their network based on their address spaces.
   The packets which have inappropriate source address for the network
   would never reach destination.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 multi-homing withou NAT            April 2010


   How about resolving destination address with FQDN?  In multi-home
   environment, we assume that address space based partitioning is not
   only network, but also DNS server's database.  What this means that
   if the multihomed host does not know the correct DNS server to
   resolve destination, the response would be whether correct or
   poisoning.

   Two or more global unique address set to one host confuses the host
   because there is nothing to consult, communication with destination
   would be obstruct after all.

   Multihoming is not the only case of IPv6, of course exists in IPv4.
   What the reason of why it does not become problem in IPv4 networks?
   The answer is NAT.

   If a host connect network behind IPv4 NAT, the host has one private
   address in local network.  There is no confusion.  The NAT becomes
   the gateway of the host, and forwards the packet aiming at an
   appropriate network when it is multihomed.  It operates also DNS
   cache server of which undertaken all inquires, and gives a correct
   answer to the host.

   NAT, how it's wonderful function, bearing the key role of the address
   saving as well as the anchor of multihoming.

   Do we try to exclude NAT that is the success factor of multihoming?
   Not at all!  Our wish to exclude is only address translation that
   obstructs end-to-end transparency.  People who hate the NAT have to
   recognize the multihoming scenario with IPv6 NAT then work for avoid
   it.

   As the multihoming anchor, next hop resolution, source address
   selection, and DNS resolution, must implemented these but exclude the
   NAT.  Otherwise, the nightmare of NAT will overcome us even though we
   have achieved the IPv6 Internet.

   In this document, we describe the analysis of the function that has
   been indiscriminately brought together in NAT by now, and also
   describe the requirements of IPv6 networking with multihoming that
   doesn't need NAT.  We then introduce useful activity for these, and
   support it strongly.

3.  IPv6 multi-homed network scenarios

   In this section, we classify that three scenarios of the multihoming
   environment.

3.1.  Classification of network scenarios for a multihomed host

   Scenario 1:

   A multihomed host has single uplink, but multiple nexthops via shared
   segment link.  Since each network advertise their prefix and DNS
   server address independently, the host would have multiple prefixes
   on the link correspond to each network and keep each DNS server
   address accordingly.

                |   |      |     \      1      /

                |   |      |      /           \
                +---| rtr2 |=====/   network   \
                    |      |     \      2      /
                    +------+      \___________/


     Figure 1.  Scenario1: single uplink, multiple next-hop, multiple
                                  prefix

                                 Figure 1

   Figure 1 illustrates that the host connect to rtr1 and rtr2 via
   shared link. network1 and 2 are reachable via rtr1 and rtr2
   respectively.  When the host send packets network1, the nexthop to
   network1 is rtr1.  Similarly,rtr2 is the netxhop to network2.

   - e.g, Broadband service (Internet, VoIP, IPTV, etc.,)

   Scenario 2:

   A multihomed host has single uplink and single nexthop to gateway.
   As the gateway connects to multiple networks, multiple prefix

   delegations and DNS server addresses come from each network.  The
   gateway advertises multiple prefix and single DNS server address to
   the host accordingly.  As a result, the host has multiple prefixes on
   the link and single DNS server address.



                              +------+       ___________
                              |      |      /           \

                              |      |     \      2      /
                              +------+      \___________/


   Figure 2.  Scenario2: single uplink, single next-hop, multiple prefix

                                 Figure 2

   Figure 2 illustrates that the host connected to GW rtr.  GW rtr
   connect to network1 and 2 via rtr1 and rtr2 respectively.  When the
   host send packets to either network1 and 2, the nexthop is GW rtr.
   When the packets toward network1, GW rtr forward the packets to rtr1.
   Similarly, rtr2 for network2.

   - e.g, Internet + VPN/ASP

   Scenario 3:

   A multihomed host has multiple uplinks and multiple nexthops.  As the
   host connects to multiple networks, multiple prefix advertisements
   and DNS server addresses come from each network.  As a result, the
   host has multiple addresses, each link has a address.

   Figure 3 illustrates that the host connect to rtr1 and rtr2 via
   direct connect or virtual link.  When the host send packets network1,
   the nexthop to network1 is rtr1.  Similarly, rtr2 is the netxhop to
   network2.

   - e.g, Mobile Wifi + 3G, ISP A + ISP B

3.2.  Multihomed network environment

   IPv6 multihomed network, a host has assigned two or more IPv6
   addresses from networks, also got information of two or more DNS
   addresses.  When the multihomed host communicate with other host,
   unfortunately it would be fail so that selection of nexthop, source
   address, DNS server policy does not accurate.

   Multi-homed network has exsisted in a IPv4 environment.  But we got
   no trouble with connecting network and using services because of NAT
   router function.

   Studying IPv4 NAT router function would be good analysis the
   multihoming problems for IPv6.  The functions of IPv4 NAT router has
   not only saving address space, but also key function of multihoming.
   These functiuons are such as next hop resolution, source address
   selection and DNS resolution.  We can't get end-to-end transparency
   with avoiding NAT unless deploying multihomed host and/or node on
   which these three functions implemented.

3.3.  Problem happens at multihoming scenarios

   The multihomed host got one more IPv6 prefixes and DNS cache
   information.  If connecting network or service, the host must decide
   next host resolution, source address selection and DNS cache
   resolution.

   For the security reason, network connectivity and accessing DNS
   servers are limited by network operators based on their own managed
   address space with uRPF and access filter techniques.

   With current IPv6 standard protocol suite, we found problems as
   below:

   Scenario 1:

   - The host send a packet with wrong source address, they throws it
   away with the network administrators policy.

   - The host send a packet to wrong next hop, they throws it away with
   the network administrators policy.

   Scenario 2:

   - The host send a packet with wrong source address, they throws it
   away with the network administrators policy.

   - The gateway router send a packet to wrong next hop, they throws it
   away with the network administrators policy.

   Scenario 3:

   - The host send a packet to wrong uplink, they throws it away with
   the network administrators policy.

   All scenario:

   - The host send DNS query to wrong DNS cache, it got no answer.

6.  Requirements

   This section describes requirements that solution mechanisms for
   multi-address and multi-uplink problem have to fulfill.

6.1.  End-to-End transparency

   End-to-end transparency is basic concept of Internet.  RFC4966
   describes as follows."One of the major design goals for IPv6 is to
   restore the end-to-end transparency of the Internet.  Therefore,
   because IPv6 may be expected to remove the need for NATs and similar
   impediments to transparency, developers creating applications to work
   with IPv6 may be tempted to assume that the complex expedients that
   might have been needed to make the application work in a 'NATted'
   IPv4 environment are not required."  Solution mechanisms SHOULD
   guarantee end-to-end transparency.

6.2.  Policy enforcement

   Solution mechanisms SHOULD have a function to enforce a policy to
   sites/nodes.  Especially in managed environment such as enterprise
   networks, an administrator have to control all nodes in his network.

   This enforcement mechanisms should have: - function to distribute
   policies to nodes dynamically Nodes' behavior can be dynamically
   updated.  When the network structure changes and the nodes' behavior
   has to be changed accordingly, a network administrator can modify the
   behavior of nodes.

   - function to control every node centrally The nodes' behavior can be
   centrally controlled.  A site administrator or a service provider
   could determine or could have an effect on the behavior at their
   users' hosts.

   - function to control node specific behavior The mechanism can
   support node-specific behavior control.  Even when multiple nodes are
   on the same subnet, the mechanism should be able to provide a method
   for the network administrator to make nodes behave differently.  For
   example, each node may have a different set of assigned prefixes.  In
   such a case, the appropriate behavior may be different.

6.3.  Scalability

   Solution mechanisms have to be able to manage large number of sites/
   nodes.  In services for residential users, provider edge devices have
   to manage thousand of sites.  In such environment, sending packets
   periodically to each sites may impact edge system performance, so
   static configuration mechanisms such as DHCPv6 are suitable for such

Internet-Draft        IPv6 multi-homing withou NAT            April 2010


   cases.


7.  Implementation approach

   As mentioned in Section 3, in the multi-prefix environment, we have
   three problems of the source address selection, the route selection,
   and the DNS server selection.  In this section, the possible solution
   mechanisms for each problem are introduced and examined against the
   requirements described in Section 4.

   * The source address selection

   The possible solutions and their evaluation are summarized in
   draft-ietf-6man-addr-select-sol.  When those solutions are examined
   against the requirements in Section 4, the proactive approaches, such
   as the policy table distribution mechanism and the routing system
   assistance mechanism, are more appropriate in that these mechanisms
   can propagate network administrators policy directly.  The policy
   distribution mechanism has an advantage with regard to the host's
   protocol stack impact, and the staticness of the assumed target
   network environment.

   * The route selection

   Just like the source address selection problem, both poliby based
   approach and non policy basd approach are possible with regard to the
   route selection problem.  Because of the same requirement the policy
   propagation based solution mechanism, whatever the policy looks like,
   should be more appropriate.

   Routing information is typical example of the policy related to route
   selection.  If we assume the source address based routing at hosts or
   intermediate routers, the pairs of source address ranges and next-
   hops can be another example of route selection policy.

   The routing information based approach has a clear advantage on the
   point of the implementational and operational experiences.

   The existing proposed or standardized routing information
   distribution mechanisms are the routing protocols, such as RIPng and
   OSPFv3, the RA (Router Advertisement) extention option defined in RFC
   4191, the DHCPv6 route information option proposed in draft-woj, and
   the TR-069 standardized at BBF.

   The RA based mechanism has difficulty in per-host routing information
   distribution.  The dynamic routing protocols like RIPng are not
   usually used between the residential users and ISP networks because



Troan                    Expires October 3, 2010               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft        IPv6 multi-homing withou NAT            April 2010


   of their scalability implications.  DHCPv6 mechanism does not have
   these difficulties and has an advantage of its relaying functionality
   and deploymental experiences.

   Regarding TR-069, this is a possible solution mechanism for routing
   information distribution to CPE.  It assumes, however, the IP
   reachability to the ACS (Auto Configuration Server) is established.
   Therefore, if the CPE needs routing information to reach the ACS, TR-
   069 cannot be used to distribute the routing information.

   * The DNS server selection

   Just like the above two problems, policy based approach and non-
   policy based approach are possible.  In non-policy based approach, a
   host or a home gateway router is assumed to send DNS queries to every
   or several DNS servers at once or one by one.

   In the non-policy based approach, however, by making a query to non-
   service providing ASP, a user can be directed to unexpected IP
   address, and cannot enjoy the ASP's private and legitimate service.
   For example, some DNS servers replys different answers depending on
   the source address of the DNS query, which is sometimes called split-
   horizon.  When the user mistakenly makes a query to different ASP's
   DNS server to resolve a FQDN of a certain ASP's private service, and
   the ASP's DNS server adopts the split-hoziontal DNS configuration,
   the queried DNS server resolves a IP address of the non-private side
   of the service.  Another problem with this approach is to cause
   unnecessary DNS traffic to the DNS servers that are visible to the
   users.

   Regarding policy based approach, draft-teemu is proposed in IETF,
   where several pairs of DNS server addresses and DNS domain suffixes
   are defined as policy and contained in DHCP new option.  In a
   environment where a home gateway router exists, the home gateway
   router can act as a DNS proxy, interprets this option and distribute
   DNS queries to the appropriate DNS servers according to the policy in

8.  Consideration for legacy host support

   This section presents serveral option along with legacy host.  There
   may still remain the above issues on legacy hosts, which cannot
   support the enhancement of 'source address selection policy'
   described in Chapter 5.x.  Considering the various networking devices
   such as Set-top Box, DVR, video game console and etc. have widely
   been used in current residential network, it is expected to remain
   without upgrade for long periods.  For supporting those legacy host,

   some kind of solution needs to be provided.  The following is the
   option on CPE device to mitigate it to a certain extent.

   This draft intends to raise the need for holistic approach in
   multiprefix environment.  Details of the problem in these option are
   not covered.

8.1.  Discrete interface

   CPE has multiple LAN interfaces or multiple logical interfaces, which
   are divided internally to associate the specific LAN interface with
   each service.  Hosts are connected to each interface associated with
   the service.  In this way, the host could substantively bind its
   source address to the appropriate service.  While the usability could
   be impaired for some users.  This is applicable to Scenario 2.

8.2.  Rewriting source prefix

   A single prefix (global or ULA) is given to the hosts.  Then its
   source prefix is rewritten at the CPE to the associated prefix
   according to the destination or service. a.k.a.  NAT66
   (draft-mrw-behave-nat66).  The usability could be improved compared
   with Option 2.  Although it is recognized that there will be issues
   in transparency of application due to the changing of source address.
   This is applicable to Scenario 1,2 and 3.


9.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define any new mechanisms.  Each solution
   mechanisms should consider security risks independently.  Security
   risks which occur as a result of combing solution mechanisms have to
   consider in another document.
