         IPv6 Multi-homing without Network Address Translation
                draft-troan-multihoming-without-nat66-00

Abstract

   Network Address Translation (NAT) works well not only for conserving
   global address but also addressing multihoming requirements because a
   IPv4 NAT router implements three functions: next-hop resolution;
   source address selection, and; optional DNS resolution.  For IPv6
   hosts one approach could be the use of NAT66 however there is a
   desire to avoid NAT, if at all possible, to permit transparent host-
   to-host connectivity.  In this document, we analyze the use cases of
   multihoming and also describe functional requirements for multihoming
   without the use of NAT in IPv6 for hosts and small IPv6 networks
   which would otherwise be unable to meet minimum IPv6 allocation
   criteria .

Internet-Draft        IPv6 multi-homing without NAT             May 2010


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 provides enough globally unique addresses to permit every
   conceivable host on the Internet to be uniquely addressed without the
   requirement for Network Address Translation (NAT) offering a
   renaissance in host-to-host transparent connectivity.

   Unfortunately, such dream could be corrupted by the necessity of NAT
   even in IPv6.  The reason is Multihoming.

   Multihoming is a blanket term to describe a host or small network
   that is connected to more than one upstream network.  Whenever a host
   or small network (which does not meet minimum IPv6 allocation
   criteria) is connected to multiple upstream networks IPv6 addressing
   is assigned by each respective service provider resulting in hosts
   with more than one active IPv6 address.  As each service provided is
   allocated different address space from their Internet Registry they
   in-turn assign different address space to the end-user network or
   host.  For example, a remote access user may use a VPN to
   simultaneously connect to a remote network and retain a default route
   to the Internet for other purposes.

   In IPv4 a common solution to the multihoming problem is to employ NAT
   on a border router and use private address space for individual host
   addressing.  The use of NAT allows hosts to have exactly one IP
   address and the combination of NAT with provider-specific outside
   addresses (one for each uplink) and destination-based routing
   insulates a host from the impacts of multiple upstream networks.  It
   may also implement a DNS cache or DNS policy to resolve address
   queries from hosts.  If our goal is to avoid the IPv6-equivilent of
   NAT then we must provided a mechanism for end-user hosts to have
   multiple address assignments and resolve issues such as which address
   to use for sourcing traffic to which destination.

   If multiple routers exist on a single link the host must
   appropriately select next-hop for each of connected network.  Routing
   protocols which would normally be employed for router-to-router
   network advertisement seem inappropriate for use towards individual
   hosts.

   Source address selection also becomes difficult whenever a host has
   more than one address within the same address scope.  Current address
   selection criteria may result in hosts using an arbitrary or random
   address when sourcing upstream traffic.  Unfortunately for the host
   the appropriate source address is a function of which upstream
   network the packet is bound for.  When an upstream service provider
   employed IP anti-spoofing or uRPF it is conceivable that the packets
   which have inappropriate source address for the upstream network

   would never reach their destination.

   In multihomed environment, different DNS scopes or partitions may
   exist in each independent upstream network.  A DNS query sent to an
   arbitrary upstream resolver may result in incorrect or poisoned
   responses.

   In short, while IPv6 facilitates hosts having more than one address
   in the same address scope the application of this causes significant
   issues for a host from a routing, source address selection and DNS
   resolution perspectives.  A possible consequence to assigning a host
   multiple identical-scoped addresses is severely impaired IP
   connectivity.

   If a host connect network behind IPv4 NAT, the host has one private
   address in local network.  There is no confusion.  The NAT becomes
   the gateway of the host, and forwards the packet aiming at an
   appropriate network when it is multi-homed.  It operates also DNS
   cache server of which undertaken all inquires, and gives a correct
   answer to the host.

   In this document, we identify the functions present in multihomed
   IPv4 NAT environments and propose requirements which address
   multihomed IPv6 environments without employing IPv6 NAT.


2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  IPv6 multi-homed network scenarios

   In this section, we classify that three scenarios of the multihoming
   environment.

3.1.  Classification of network scenarios for a multihomed host

   Scenario 1:

   In this scenario two or more routers are present on a single link
   shared with the host(s).  Each router is in turn connected to a
   different service provider network which provides independent address
   assignment and DNS resolvers.  A host in this environment would be
   offered multiple prefixes and DNS resolvers advertised from the two
   different routers.

     Figure 1.  Scenario1: single uplink, multiple next-hop, multiple

                                 Figure 1

   Figure 1 illustrates that the host connect to rtr1 and rtr2 via
   shared link. network1 and 2 are reachable via rtr1 and rtr2
   respectively.  When the host send packets network1, the next-hop to
   network1 is rtr1.  Similarly, rtr2 is the next-hop to network2.

   - e.g, Broadband service (Internet, VoIP, IPTV, etc.,)

   Scenario 2:

   In this scenario a single gateway router connects the host to two or
   more upstream service provider networks.  This gateway router would
   receive prefix delegations from each independent service provider
   network and a different set of DNS resolvers.  The gateway in-turn
   advertises the provider prefixes to the host and for DNS may either
   perform a lightweight DNS reslover/cache or may advertise the
   complete set of service provider DNS resolvers to the hosts.

   When the packets toward network1, GW rtr forward the packets to rtr1.
   Similarly, rtr2 for network2.

   Scenario 3:

   In this scenario a host has more than one active interfaces which
   connect to different routers and service provider networks.  Each
   router provides the host with a different address prefix and set of
   DNS resolvers resulting in a host with a unique address per link/
   interface.

3.2.  Multihomed network environment

   In an IPv6 multihomed network a host is assigned two or more IPv6
   addresses and DNS resolvers from independent service provider
   networks.  When this multihomed host attempts a connections with
   other hosts it may incorrectly resolve next-hop router, use an
   inappropriate source address or use a DNS response from the incorrect
   service provider that may result in impaired IP connectivity.

   Multihomed networks in IPv4 have been commonly solved through the use
   of a gateway router with NAT function (scenario 2 with NAT).  An
   analysis of the current IPv4 NAT and DNS functions within the gateway
   router should provide a baseline set of requirements for IPv6
   multihomed environments.  Destination prefix/route is often used on
   the gateway router to separate traffic between the networks.

3.3.  Multihomed Problem Statement

   A multihomed IPv6 host has one or more assigned IPv6 address and DNS
   resolver from each upstream service provider, resulting in the host
   having multiple valid IPv6 addresses and DNS resolvers.  The host
   must be able to resolve the appropriate next-hop, the correct source
   address and DNS resolver to use based on destination prefix.  To
   prevent IP spoofing operators will often implement IP filters and
   uRPF to discard traffic with an inappropriate source address, making
   it essential for the host to correctly resolve these three criteria
   before sourcing the first packet.

   IPv6 has mechanisms for the provision of multiple routers on a single
   link and multiple address assignments to a single host, however when
   applied to the three Scenario's in section 3.1 a number of
   connectivity issues are identified:

   Scenario 1:

   The host has been assigned an address from each router and learnt
   both rtr1 and rtr2 as valid default routers (in the default routers
   list).

   - The source address selection policy on the host does not
   deterministically resolve a source address.  Upstream uRPF or filter
   policies will discard traffic with source addresses that the operator
   did not assign.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 multi-homing without NAT             May 2010


   - The host will select one of the two routers as the active default
   router.  No traffic is sent to the other router.

   Scenario 2:

   The host has been assigned two different address from the single
   gateway router.  The gateway router is the only default router on the
   link.

   - The source address selection policy on the host does not
   deterministically resolve a source address.  Upstream uRPF or filter
   policies will discard traffic with source addresses that the operator
   did not assign.

   - The gateway router does not have a mechanism for determining which
   traffic should be sent to which network.  If the gateway router is
   implementing host functions (ie, processing RA) then two valid
   default routers may be learnt.

   Scenario 3:

   A host has two separate interfaces and on each interface a different
   address is assigned.  Each link has its own router.

   - The source address selection policy on the host does not
   deterministically resolve a source address.  Upstream uRPF or filter
   policies will discard traffic with source addresses that the operator
   did not assign.

   - The host will select one of the two routers as the active default
   router.  No traffic is sent to the other router.

   All scenario:

   - The host may use the incorrect DNS resolver for DNS queries.


4.  Terminology


5.  Problem statement and Analysis

   The problems described in section 2 can be classified into these
   three problems:

      - Wrong next-hop selection

Internet-Draft        IPv6 multi-homing without NAT             May 2010


      - Wrong source address selection

      - Wrong DNS server selection

   This section reviews the problem statements presented above and
   proposed functional requirements to resolve the issues without
   employing IPv6 NAT.

5.1.  Next-hop selection

   A multihomed IPv6 host or gateway may have multiple plinks to
   different service providers.  Here each router would use Router
   Advertisements [RFC4861] for distributing default route/next-hop
   information to the host or gateway router.

   In this case, the host or gateway router may select any valid default
   router from the default routers list, resulting in traffic being sent
   to the wrong router and discarded by the upstream service provider.
   Using the above scenarios as an example, whenever the host wishes to
   reach a destination in network 2 and there is no connectivity between
   network 1 and network 2 (as is the case for a walled-garden or closed
   service), the host or gateway router does not know whether to forward
   traffic to rtr1 or rtr2 to reach a destination in network 2.  The
   host or gateway router may choose rtr1 as the default router and
   traffic failing to reach the destination server.  The host or gateway
   router requires route information for each upstream service provider,
   but the use of a routing protocol between a host and router causes
   both configuration and scaling issues.  For IPv4 hosts, the gateway
   router was often pre-configured with static route information or made
   use of Classless Static Route Options [RFC3442] for DHCPv4.
   Extensions to Router Advertisements through Default Router Preference
   and More-Specific Routes [RFC4191] provides for link-specific
   preferences but does not address per-host configuration in a multi-
   access topology because of it's reliance on Router Advertisements.  A
   DHCPv6 option, such as is described in [draft-dec] is preferred for
   host-specific configuration.  By employing a DHCPv6 solution a DHCPv6
   server could restrict address assignment (of additional prefixes)
   only to hosts which support more advanced next-hop and address
   selection requirements.

   Scenario 1: "Host" needs to support the solution for this problem

   Scenario 2: "GW rtr" needs to support the solution for this problem

   Scenario 3: "Host" needs to support the solution for this problem

Internet-Draft        IPv6 multi-homing without NAT             May 2010


5.2.  Source address selection

   A multihomed IPv6 host will typically have different addresses
   assigned from each service provider either on the same link (scenario
   1 & 2) or different links (scenario 3).  When the host wishes to send
   a packet towards any given destination the current source address
   selection rules [RFC3484] may not deterministically resolve the
   correct source address when host addressing was via RA or DHCPv6.  In
   [draft-ietf-6man-addr-select-soln] describes the use of the policy
   table [RFC3484] to resolve this problem, however there is no
   mechanism defined to disseminate policy table information to a host.
   A proposal exists in [draft-fujisaki-dhc-addr-select-opt] to provide
   a DHCPv6 mechanism for host policy table management.

   Again, by employing DHCPv6 the server could restrict address
   assignment (of additional prefixes) only to hosts which support
   policy-table management.

   Scenario 1: "Host" needs to support the solution for this problem

   Scenario 2: "Host" needs to support the solution for this problem

   Scenario 3: "Host" needs to support the solution for this problem

5.3.  DNS server selection

   A multihomed IPv6 host or gateway router may be provided multiple DNS
   resolvers through DHCPv6 or the experimental RFC 5006.  When the host
   or gateway router sends a DNS query it would normally choose one of
   the available DNS resolvers for the query.

   In the IPv6 gateway router scenario, the Broadband Forum TR-124
   required that the query was sent to all DNS resolvers and the gateway
   waits for the first reply.  In IPv6, given our employment of specific
   destination-based policy for both routing and source address
   selection, it is desirable to extend a policy-based concept to DNS
   resolver selection.  Doing so can minimize DNS resolver load and
   avoid issues where DNS resolvers in different networks have
   connectivity issues, or the DNS resolvers are not publicly
   accessible.  In the worst case, a DNS query may be unanswered if sent
   towards the incorrect resolver resulting in a lack of connectivity.

   An IPv6 multihomed host or gateway router should have the ability to
   select appropriate DNS resolvers for each service based on domain
   space for the destination, and each service should provide rules
   specific to that network. [draft-savolainen-mif-dns-server-selection]
   proposes DNS server selection policy enforcement solution with DHCPv6
   option.

6.  Requirements

   This section describes requirements that any solution multi-address
   and multi-uplink architectures need to meet.

6.1.  End-to-End transparency

   End-to-end transparency is basic concept of the Internet.  RFC4966
   describes as follows."One of the major design goals for IPv6 is to
   restore the end-to-end transparency of the Internet.  Therefore,
   because IPv6 is expected to remove the need for NATs and similar
   impediments to transparency, developers creating applications to work
   with IPv6 may be tempted to assume that the complex mechanisms
   employed by an application to work in a 'NATted' IPv4 environment are
   not required.  The IPv6 multihoming solution SHOULD guarantee end-to-
   end transparency by avoiding IPv6 NAT.

6.2.  Policy enforcement

   The solution SHOULD have a function to enforce a policy to sites/
   nodes.  Especially in managed environment such as enterprise
   networks, an administrator have to control all nodes in his network.

   This enforcement mechanisms should have:

   - a function to distribute policies to nodes dynamically to update
   their behaviour.  When the network environment changes and the nodes'
   behavior has to be changed, a network administrator can modify the
   behavior of nodes.

   - a function to control every node centrally.  A site administrator
   or a service provider could determine or could have an effect on the
   behavior at their users' hosts.

   - a function to control node specific behavior.  Even when multiple
   nodes are on the same subnet, the mechanism should be able to provide
   a method for the network administrator to make nodes behave
   differently.  For example, each node may have a different set of
   assigned prefixes.  In such a case, the appropriate behavior may be
   different.

6.3.  Scalability

   The solution will have to be able to manage a large number of sites/
   nodes.  In services for residential users, provider edge devices have
   to manage thousand of sites.  In such environments, sending packets
   periodically to each site may impact edge system performance.
   Configuration mechanisms such as DHCPv6 are suitable for such cases.


7.  Implementation approach

   As mentioned in Section 3, in the multi-prefix environment, we have
   three problems in source address selection, route selection, and DNS
   resolver selection.  In this section, possible solution mechanisms
   for each problem are introduced and evaluated against the
   requirements in Section 4.

   * Source address selection

   Possible solutions and their evaluation are summarized in
   draft-ietf-6man-addr-select-sol.  When those solutions are examined
   against the requirements in Section 4, the proactive approaches, such
   as the policy table distribution mechanism and the routing system
   assistance mechanism, are more appropriate in that these mechanisms
   can propagate network administrators policy directly.  The policy
   distribution mechanism has an advantage with regard to the host's
   protocol stack impact, and the staticness of the assumed target
   network environment.

   * Route selection

   Just like the source address selection problem, both a policy-based
   approach and a non policy-based approach are possible with regard to
   the route selection problem.  Because of the same requirement the
   policy propagation based solution mechanism, whatever the policy
   looks like, should be more appropriate.

   Routing information is a typical example of policy related to route
   selection.  If we assume source address-based routing at hosts or
   intermediate routers, the pairs of source prefixes and next-hops can
   be another example of route selection policy.

   The routing information based approach has a clear advantage on the
   point of the implementation and operational experiences.

   The existing proposed or standardized routing information
   distribution mechanisms are the routing protocols, such as RIPng and
   OSPFv3, the RA (Router Advertisement) extension option defined in RFC



Troan                   Expires November 19, 2010              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        IPv6 multi-homing without NAT             May 2010


   4191, the DHCPv6 route information option proposed in draft-woj, and
   the TR-069 standardized at BBF.

   The RA based mechanism has difficulty in per-host routing information
   distribution.  The dynamic routing protocols like RIPng are not
   usually used between the residential users and ISP networks because
   of their scalability implications.  DHCPv6 mechanism does not have
   these difficulties and has an advantage of its relaying functionality
   and deployment experiences.

   Regarding TR-069, this is a possible solution mechanism for routing
   information distribution to CPE.  It assumes, however, the IP
   reachability to the ACS (Auto Configuration Server) is established.
   Therefore, if the CPE needs routing information to reach the ACS, TR-
   069 cannot be used to distribute the routing information.

   * DNS Resolver selection

   Just like the above two problems, a policy-based approach and non
   policy-based approach are possible.  In non policy-based approach a
   host or a home gateway router is assumed to send DNS queries to
   several DNS servers at once or to select one of the available
   servers.

   In the non policy-based approach by making a query to a resolver in a
   different service provider to that which hosts the service, a user
   could be directed to unexpected IP address or receive an invalid
   response, and cannot connect to the service provider's private and
   legitimate service.  For example, some DNS servers replies different
   answers depending on the source address of the DNS query, which is
   sometimes called split-horizon.  When the host mistakenly makes a
   query to different provider's DNS to resolve a FQDN of another
   provider's private service, and DNS resolver adopts the split-horizon
   configuration, the queried server returns an IP address of the non-
   private side of the service.  Another problem with this approach is
   to cause unnecessary DNS traffic to the DNS resolvers that are
   visible to the users.

   The alternative of a policy-based approach is documented in [draft-
   teemu], where several pairs of DNS resolver addresses and DNS domain
   suffixes are defined as part of a policy and conveyed to hosts in a
   new DHCP new.  In a environment where a home gateway router exists,
   the home gateway router can act as a DNS proxy, interpret this option
   and distribute DNS queries to the appropriate DNS servers according
   to the policy.

8.  Consideration for legacy host support

   This section presents alternative approach to mitigate the problem in
   a multihomed network.  This approach will help legacy IPv6 hosts
   which are not capable of the enhancements for source address
   selection policy, next-hop selection policy and DNS selection policy
   described in section 7.  The idea is to assign only a single address
   to the host.  The other three features need to be implemented into GW
   rtr in Scenario 2 alongside an IPv6 NAT component.

   Furthermore, In case of typical IPv4 multihomed network deployment,
   IPv4 NAT is practically used and it can eventually avoid assigning
   multiple addresses to the hosts and solve the next-hop selection
   problem.  In a similar fashion, IPv6 NAT can be used as a last resort
   for IPv6 multihomed network deployments where one needs to assign a
   single IPv6 address to a host.

   Considering the scenario 2 as a popular deployment for residential
   network, legacy hosts such as PC, Mac and also any other networked
   appliances (STB and gaming console) can be helped by GW rtr with IPv6
   NAT.

   IPv6 NAT is implemented on GW rtr.  Only a single prefix (global or
   ULA) is assigned to a host.  Its source prefix is rewritten at the GW
   rtr to the associated prefix according to the destination or service.
   Here is a possible implementation on GW rtr.

   7.

   The implementation and issues of IPv6 NAT are out of the scope of
   this document.  It may be covered by other document under discussion
   (draft-mrw-behave-nat66).


9.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define any new mechanisms.  Each solution
   mechanisms should consider security risks independently.  Security
   risks which occur as a result of combing solution mechanisms have to
   consider in another document.
